Rational: By recording the number of comparisons and movements
of each algorithm with list size 6 and 100, we can use these data to
determine the type of each algorithm.

Conclusion:

Alpha is Merge Sort.
Reason: By running this algorithm on
different sizes of data, we can see that the number of comparisons are always
the same in all cases. This is the characteristic of Merge Sort.
Merge sort will always take log2n divisions.
Whether it is best or the worst case, and depth of the tree will always be the same.
Moreover, it will always compare each pair of numbers to merge.

Beta is Bubble Sort.
Reason: We can see that for different sizes of data,
the number of comparisons are always N-1 for best case.

Gamma is Insertion Sort.
Reason: The best case and worst case running time is matched beterrn
Insertion Sort and Gamma.

Delta is Quick Sort.
Reason: The average number comparison is close to NlogN.

Epsilon is Selection Sort.
Reason: The average number comparison is close to N-square,
and the number of movement is matched.

Zeta is Check Sort.
Reason: It takes the longest running time.
